# Check out the raw cces tibble, especially the faminc (family income) and
# ideology variables.

x <- cces %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  select(state, gender, age, race, faminc, ideology) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  
  # This is an absurd hack. Do not do this, ever. This only works because, if
  # you coerce factor variables into integers, the order of the factor levels is
  # preserved. So, low numbers for faminc/ideology correspond to poorer/liberal
  # individuals.
  
  # We need the variables, at least faminc, to be numeric so that we can create
  # a statistical model using the tools we have learned.
  
  mutate(faminc = as.integer(faminc)) %>% 
  mutate(ideology = as.integer(ideology))

*Describe the relationship between ideology and family income. How does it vary by gender? Does your conclusion change if we "adjust" for race and age?*
